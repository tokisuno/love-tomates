# Pomodoro Timer in LÃ–VE2D
## Purpose?
I was bored and wanted to learn how to use love2d. That's it. I also haven't touched the code for my timer in Raylib in a while and I don't really use C, so I wanted to see how I could do the same thing with lua instead.

## Functionality
- Study timer
- Break timer
- Fun sound effects

## Keymaps
- Start today's sessions
- Next session
- Go back a session in case of mistake

## Usage
